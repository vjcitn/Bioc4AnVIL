Description: This package is focused on providing insight
	on how Bioconductor and NHGRI AnVIL can be symbiotic.
	This package will be the basis of a managed workspace
	with QA processes that can be emulated in research
	workspaces.  This package will include vignettes
	that work through operations with key Bioconductor
	resources.
