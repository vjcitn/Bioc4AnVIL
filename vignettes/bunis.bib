  abstract  = "Whereas the human fetal immune system is poised to generate
               immune tolerance and suppress inflammation in utero, an
               adult-like immune system emerges to orchestrate anti-pathogen
               immune responses in post-natal life. It has been posited that
               cells of the adult immune system arise as a discrete ontological
               ``layer'' of hematopoietic stem-progenitor cells (HSPCs) and
               their progeny; evidence supporting this model in humans has,
               however, been inconclusive. Here, we combine bulk and
               single-cell transcriptional profiling of lymphoid cells, myeloid
               cells, and HSPCs from fetal, perinatal, and adult developmental
               stages to demonstrate that the fetal-to-adult transition occurs
               progressively along a continuum of maturity-with a substantial
               degree of inter-individual variation at the time of birth-rather
               than via a transition between discrete waves. These findings
               have important implications for the design of strategies for
               prophylaxis against infection in the newborn and for the use of
               umbilical cord blood (UCB) in the setting of transplantation.",
